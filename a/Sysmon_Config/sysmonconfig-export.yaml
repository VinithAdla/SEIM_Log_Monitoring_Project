# Sysmon Configuration

This folder contains the `sysmonconfig-export.xml` file used to configure Microsoft Sysmon (System Monitor) for enhanced Windows event logging and threat detection.

## 🔧 What Is Sysmon?

[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that logs system activity to the Windows Event Log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, file time changes, and more.

## 📄 File Included

- **sysmonconfig-export.xml**: The configuration file used when installing Sysmon. This file defines which events Sysmon collects and how.

## ⚙️ How I Used It

As part of my cybersecurity lab:
- I installed Sysmon on a Windows VM using this config file.
- Collected detailed Windows event logs to monitor:
  - Process creations
  - Network connections
  - Image loads
  - Registry changes
- Forwarded these logs using Winlogbeat to Logstash and visualized them in Splunk.

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understood the importance of granular log collection for incident detection.
- Gained experience customizing and deploying Sysmon configurations.
- Mapped event IDs from Sysmon to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
