# SIEM_Log_Monitoring_Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab setup using **Sysmon**, **Winlogbeat**, **Logstash**, and **Splunk** to detect suspicious processes and visualize activity in a SOC-style dashboard.  
It simulates real-world detection and monitoring use cases that SOC analysts perform daily.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Sysmon** â€“ Captures detailed Windows event logs (process creation, network connections, etc.)
- **Winlogbeat** â€“ Ships Windows Event Logs to Logstash
- **Logstash** â€“ Parses and forwards logs to Splunk via HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
- **Splunk** â€“ Visualizes logs, detects anomalies, and builds dashboards

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Collect and ship Windows logs using Sysmon and Winlogbeat
- Parse and normalize logs with Logstash
- Forward logs to Splunk for indexing and analysis
- Create dashboards to identify suspicious activity such as PowerShell or cmd.exe executions
- Simulate SOC-style alert triage and investigation

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases
- **Suspicious Process Detection** â€“ Identify execution of potentially malicious processes
- **Host Activity Tracking** â€“ Monitor event frequency and anomalies
- **SOC Visualization** â€“ Use Splunk dashboards for rapid detection and analysis
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** â€“ Link detection logic to adversary tactics and techniques
